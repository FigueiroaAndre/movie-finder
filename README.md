# Movie - Finder
This project is a *Movie Finder* written in [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) and using the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). This project is inspired in [1 - An Overview about the app & Why to use React with Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0WWc5dyLE&list=PLG3RxIUKLJlbDDGeeoUCkinS2DUybp_1o) youtube video.

## Project Status
In Development

## Goals
This is the first project, using react, that i'll develop alone. That's being said, the main goal of this project is practice with the library.

## Required Features
- [ ] Search bar: User can search for movies using the search bar, the page will only start the search after user hit the **Search** button.
- [ ] Display movies list: After the user hit search, that application have to make a request to the api, and then return both the title and the poster of the movie.
- [ ] Movie Info: If the user click on a movie in the movies list, then a page with more information of the movie will be displayed

## Desired Features
- [ ] Infinite Scroll movie list: The API supports pagination. The application should load the next page of results from the API after the last element of the last page is displayed on the screen.

## Difficulties and Decision Making
This section will be updated as the project goes forward

## Future Work
After finishing this project, i'll build a project with both frontend (ReactJS) and backend(nodeJS), with a database(MySQL).
